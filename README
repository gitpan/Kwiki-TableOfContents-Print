Kwiki-TableOfContents-Print

A addon to the Kwiki-TableOfContents module that allows you to print an entire
section. When the print function (provided by a javascript function) is
executed then a new window opens which is a concationation of the current page
followed by all pages below it. Pages are included in a depth-first order.
The print dialog will be already activated so all the user has to do is press
the print button.

If you are on the home page it will print the entire site (based on the TOC
so pages not in the TOC will not be printed) with the home page prepended.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    kwiki -install Kwiki::TableOfContents::Print
